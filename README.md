## Main gols :

- Only HTML / CSS: 
- Level: basic/ intermediate
- Recreate template for reference

## How to open :
- Download full project (all the files) and put all togheter in a folder
- open index.html in root folder

## Limitations:
- Because was using just intermediate HTML / CSS code, responsive pages will be limited.
- The MVP of this project is just use intermediate HTML / CSS code in order to implement layout reference as much as possible
